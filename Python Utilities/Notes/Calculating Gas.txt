Gas fee is the product of the following:

Number of gas units required
Price per gas unit, in GWEI
Price of GWEI in ETH (always a billionth of an Ether = 10e-9 ETH)
Price of ETH in, say, USD

Let's take an example. We are moving ETH between two wallets in a standard way. As you point out,
this is (always) 21,000 gas. Suppose the gas fee (number of GWEI to buy one unit of gas) is 100 and
the price of ETH is 4000.

USD price = 21,000 * 100 * 10e-9 * 4000 = $8.4

Now let's look at a more realistic example. From DeFi Dashboard I see the average gas price for
UniSwap v2 is 159,709. From Ethereum Gas Charts the average price at this time of day for this
day of the week is 134 GWEI. The price of Ether is 4701.

USD price = 159,709 * 134 * 10e-9 * 4701 = $100
